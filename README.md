# Biodiversity Data Wrangling
Materials from the macroevolution module of the workshop "Biodiversity data wrangling: Linking large phylogenies with species traits and ecologies" offered at Botany 2024 as a crash course on biodiversity data wrangling and possible uses of biodiversity data. Our main interest is in how to combine large-scale phylogenetic data with equally large-scale environmental, ecological and trait datasets. Here follows a summary of folders and files.

## Base directory
`Workshop_opening.pptx` and `Macroevolution.pptx` contain lecture slides for the morning macroevolution session. `Phenology.pptx` contains lecture slides for the afternoon session.

## `macroevolution`
This folder pertains to the morning session. Run the script `workshop.R` in R studio and set your working directory to this subfolder as well. The tree is at `workshop.tree.tre` and the rest of the files are environment and trait data.

## `phenology`
This folder pertains to the afternoon phenology session. Run the script `script.R` in R studio and set your working directory to this subfolder as well. The other file is the data file for this session.
